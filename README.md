# Blind-75
Hello freshers!

Do you overwhelm with lots of DSA problems and could not touch the advanced topics by circling in the basic DSA questions?

Don’t worry, I will teach you a magic spell - The BLIND 75.

Blind 75 is a list of 75 problems which covers almost all the inportant Datastructures and Algorithms.

Blind 75 is well known among Software Engineers because of its comprehensive coverage, efficiency, simplicity yet powerful.

These are like Maths formulae. You have to understand the concepts behind them instead of memorising.

All the best for your preparation!
